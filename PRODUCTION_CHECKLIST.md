# Production Readiness Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### Security & Performance
- ‚úÖ Added global ErrorBoundary component
- ‚úÖ Fixed dropdown z-index (z-50 ‚Üí z-[100]) for proper layering
- ‚úÖ Removed production console.logs (kept only in development mode)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling with environment-aware logging

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ Standardized error logging to development-only
- ‚úÖ Improved dropdown shadow and styling consistency
- ‚úÖ Added proper error boundaries for crash recovery

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Required Supabase Security Actions

These issues were identified by the Supabase linter and **MUST** be addressed before production:

### 1. Enable Leaked Password Protection
**Priority: CRITICAL**
- Go to: [Authentication Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lnhtlbatcufmsyoujuqh/settings/auth)
- Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
- This prevents users from using passwords found in data breaches

### 2. Upgrade Postgres Version
**Priority: HIGH**
- Current: Postgres 15.1.0.147
- Recommended: Postgres 15.6.1.121 or later
- Contains critical security patches and performance improvements
- Schedule maintenance window for upgrade

### 3. Review RLS Policies
**Priority: HIGH**
Review these tables for potential security issues:
- `class_logs` - Ensure proper RLS policies
- `class_uploads` - Verify file access restrictions
- `content_shares` - Check sharing permissions
- `scheduled_classes` - Validate user access

## üîß Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Security Hardening (DO FIRST)
1. **Enable Supabase leaked password protection** (5 minutes)
2. **Schedule Postgres upgrade** (requires maintenance window)
3. **Review and test all RLS policies** (1-2 hours)

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
1. Add React.memo to expensive components
2. Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
3. Add loading states to all async operations
4. Review and optimize database queries

### Phase 3: Code Quality
1. Complete TypeScript strict mode migration
2. Remove remaining mock data from production
3. Add comprehensive error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
4. Implement automated testing for critical paths

### Phase 4: UI/UX Polish
1. Standardize form validation across all forms
2. Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
3. Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
4. Enhance responsive design for mobile devices

## üìä Impact Assessment

### High Impact Fixes (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Error boundary prevents app crashes
- ‚úÖ Dropdown z-index fixes visual layering issues
- ‚úÖ Console.log cleanup improves performance and professionalism

### High Impact Fixes (Pending - User Action Required)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Leaked password protection (Supabase dashboard)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Postgres upgrade (Supabase dashboard)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è RLS policy review (Supabase + code)

## üéØ Production Launch Blockers

Before going live, you MUST:
1. ‚úÖ Enable leaked password protection in Supabase
2. ‚úÖ Upgrade Postgres to latest version
3. ‚úÖ Review and test all RLS policies
4. ‚úÖ Add production error monitoring
5. ‚úÖ Test authentication flows end-to-end
6. ‚úÖ Verify file upload security
7. ‚úÖ Test all critical user journeys

## üìù Notes

- All development-only console logs are now wrapped in `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')`
- Error boundary provides graceful fallback UI for production errors
- Dropdown components now have proper z-index hierarchy
- ErrorHandler service logs errors appropriately based on environment
